    -> Python 

        -> Full Stack Development               : Django (Web Applications Flask, FAST API etc)

        -> Data Analytics / Data Science / AI   : Data Operations (Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch etc)

        -> Cloud / DevOps                       : Scripting / Automation (OS, Sys, Cloud Boto3 etc)

    -> Core Python which is common for all above courses [ 35 Days ]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals 

    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    
    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High level languages are "Human Understandable" language (English) 

        -> python code looks like english 

            -> sum = num1 + num2

    
    -> Low Level Language 

        -> Low level languages are "Machine Understandable" language (Binary) 

            -> 0101010101010101

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python

    
    -> Python is "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using python, yes we can Develop following types of Applications

            -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> Web Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> Data Oriented Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> API's ? -> Yes 

            -> Automation Scripts ? -> Yes 

    
    -> Domain Specific Languages 

        -> If i can do only specific types of tasks / Applications 

        -> SQL : Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data in "Database" Systems 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the 
        use of significant "indentation"
    
        -> "code readability"

            Java Code 
            ---------
        
            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

            class 
            public
            static
            void
            []
            ()
            {}
            ; 

            
            Python Code 
            -----------

                    number1 = 10
                    number2 = 20
                    sum = number1 + number1
                    print(sum)

                
        -> "indentation"

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we just use "spaces" for indentation 

    
    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Dynamically type-checked 

            -> We have Data Types in programming languages 

                -> Data Types : Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE : Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types 

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 
                    -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked (Java)

            -> NOTE : Static type-checked means, we need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types and it's Mandatory

                    -> String product = "Apple Iphone 16";
                    -> int price = 64000;
                    -> double rating = 4.6; 
                    -> etc  

        -> Garbage-collected

            -> Removing/Cleanup Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically clean up unused data / memory (RAM)

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> python cleans up rating as it's not used 


    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> Compiled Language 

        -> An Compiled Language translates the code into machine code, executes all the code at once 

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are Faster 

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> Python has vast eco system of libraries (*)

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE (2 weeks)

            -> give me 2 years of times 

            -> With Python we don't see speed of Applications 

            -> With Python we focus on Development speed of Applications
