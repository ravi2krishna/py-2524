    -> Core Python which is common for all above courses [ 35 Days ]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals 

    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    
    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High level languages are "Human Understandable" language (English) 

        -> python code looks like english 

            -> sum = num1 + num2

    
    -> Low Level Language 

        -> Low level languages are "Machine Understandable" language (Binary) 

            -> 0101010101010101

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python

    
    -> Python is "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using python, yes we can Develop following types of Applications

            -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes

        -> SQL : Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data in "Database" Systems 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the 
        use of significant "indentation"
    
        -> "code readability"

            Java Code 
            ---------
        
            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

            class 
            public
            static
            void
            []
            ()
            {}
            ; 

            
            Python Code 
            -----------

                    number1 = 10
                    number2 = 20
                    sum = number1 + number1
                    print(sum)

                
        -> "indentation"

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we just use "spaces" for indentation 

    
    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Dynamically type-checked 

            -> We have Data Types in programming languages 

                -> Data Types : Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE : Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types 

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 
                    -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked (Java)

            -> NOTE : Static type-checked means, we need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types and it's Mandatory

                    -> String product = "Apple Iphone 16";
                    -> int price = 64000;
                    -> double rating = 4.6; 
                    -> etc  

        -> Garbage-collected

            -> Removing/Cleanup Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically clean up unused data / memory (RAM)

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> python cleans up rating as it's not used 


    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> Compiled Language 

        -> An Compiled Language translates the code into machine code, executes all the code at once 

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are Faster 

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> Python has vast eco system of libraries (*)

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE (2 weeks)

            -> give me 2 years of times 

            -> With Python we don't see speed of Applications 

            -> With Python we focus on Development speed of Applications

==============

    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to 
            conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.

        -> Problem : How To Reach Institute ?

            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk

            -> python3 --version 

    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (not recommended)

            -> We write the code in command prompt(win) / terminal(mac)

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

        -> Script Mode (recommended)

            -> We write the code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanent, stored on disk 

    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 11:15 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 11:15 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd......z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we form words and then complex sentences over time 


        -> Learn Python  

            -> Python has 35 "keywords" (which are equivalent to english Alphabets)

            -> Using these keywords we form statements using some syntax/rules in python     

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    async      elif       if         or         yield

            -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter

            
13th Nov 2025
==============

    -> Python Rules / Syntax

        -> Any python file goes with .py as extension 

        -> Python ignores lines that start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> When working with numerics(1,2,3,4.5,3.14 etc)  
            we can directly use numerics with print() 

        -> When working with text data, in python text data is called as "String"

            -> Strings are supposed to be represented using 
                double quotes "" or single quotes ''
    
    -> Identifiers 

        -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify a piece of data 
            in python code 

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 
        
        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers 

    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named storage location in computers memory (RAM)
            that holds some value or data 

        -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Variables Syntax

            -> variable_name = value

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as assignment operator 
                -> value is data you want to store 

                -> data = 10 (valid)
                -> data = ten (invalid)
                -> data = "ten" (valid) 

        -> Variables Allow You To 

            -> Assign Data (Store Data)

            -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

            -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required)

        -> Combine Variables with your custom statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining String using + operator 

            -> When Combing String with other data types like int, float etc use , operator


14th Nov 2025
==============

    -> We can verify memory location of a Variable 

        -> use id() function 

    -> Memory Model In Python 

        -> If a value is already present, python will not create a memory block
        again for the same value, when working with simple data types 

    -> To Know The Type Of Data / value  

        -> use type() function 

    -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required) Using "Operators"

    
    -> Operators

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", which Performs Operations on Variables 
            and their Values 

        -> There are different types of operator, to deal with different types of data 

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform Mathematical Calculations 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)


        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combine Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python 
        
        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In Conditional Checks 

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check multiple conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F
                            T       F           F         T         F       T
                            F       T           F         T         T       F

        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

            -> NOTE : How do i know if an object is iterable or not ?

                -> dir() - function, tells what kind of operations can be performed 

                    -> if __iter___ is found then you can iterate 
                        i.e you can go with Membership Operators


17th Nov 2025
==============

        -> Identity Operators 

            -> Used ofr checking if both objects are same 

                -> is : return True, if objects are same 

                -> is not : return True, if objects are not same 
        
       
        -> Bitwise Operators

            -> Used in Low Level Programming (010101001)

                -> & - if both bits are 1, then result is 1
                -> | - if one the bits is 1, then result is 1

        -> Data Types are Categorization that defines, what kind of data a variable can hold 

        -> Python is dynamic types language(assumes the type based on value)

    -> Numeric Types

        -> int : 1,2,3,0,-1,-2 etc 
        
        -> float : 3.5, 1.5, 2.1 1.0 etc 

        -> complex :

            -> a + ib in math (i - imaginary)

            -> a + bj in python 

    -> Text Type 

        -> str : String is a sequence of characters enclosed in ' ' or " "

    -> Boolean Type

        -> bool : Represents True / False (case sensitive)

    -> None Type

        -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 


    -> Simple Data Types : Hold Single Value in a single variable

    -> Complex Data Types : Hold Multiple Values in a single variable

    -> Sequence Types 

        -> List : List is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using []

        -> Tuple : Tuple is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using ()

        -> NOTE: Technically String is also a sequence type, as it's special 

    -> Set Type 

        -> Set : Set is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using { }

    -> Map Type 

        ->  Dictionary : dict is complex data type i.e it holds multiple key values
                  represented using { } 


    -> NOTE : All above data types are pre-defined in python standard library 

    -> NOTE : Based on custom Requirements coming from users/customers, 
                we can create our own data types 

                -> syntax

                    class CustomDataType:
                        statements

    -> Type Conversion / Implicit Conversion [ Automatic ]

        -> Converting One Data type to another data type, Automatically by Python 

        -> Type Conversion is SAFE i.e no DATA LOSS 

    -> Type Casting / Explicit Conversion [ Manual ]

        -> Converting One Data type to another data type, Manually by Developer 

        -> Type Casting is NOT SAFE i.e DATA LOSS might occur 

        -> syntax

            -> data type(value) # casting functions 


18th Nov 2025
==============

    -> Control Structures / Control statements

        -> Control Structures helps you determine the flow of execution 
            in a python program, allowing you to "make decisions" and "repeat tasks".

        -> Python has given three types of Control Structures

            -> Conditional Structures / Statements (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Structures / Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> NOTE: To Work with above Control Structures, indentation knowledge is must

    -> Indentation

        -> Indentation in Python is a fundamental and mandatory aspect of its "syntax", 
            used to define the structure and hierarchy of code blocks. 
            Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords 
            to delineate blocks, Python relies entirely on "consistent" indentation.

        -> Using space as indentation (using spaces correctly is important)

        -> Python allows for any consistent number of spaces or 
            a single tab(4 spaces) for indentation,

    -> Conditional Structures / Statements (Decision Making Statements)

        -> Used to run a "block of code" based on a condition result 

            -> if 

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements 
            
            -> if else 

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 
                    runs another block of code, if the condition is False 

                    -> syntax

            -> NOTE: Interpolation & input(), we use them for dynamic inputs & outputs 

            -> Interpolation 

                -> Interpolation technique replaces, place holders with actual values dynamically

                -> Using "f-strings" (Formatted String Literals)

                    -> we use f with print and {} as place holders 

            -> input(): function reads input from user 

        -> The ternary operator in Python, also known as a "conditional expression", 
            provides a concise way(short hand code) to write an 
            if-else statement on a single line.
             
            It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values 
            based on whether the condition is true or false.

    -> syntax 
        value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

    -> elif ladder 

        -> elif is a keyword that stands for "else if" 

        -> It is used in conditional statements to check "multiple conditions"
            sequentially after an initial if statement
        
        -> Syntax

            if condition:
                statements
            elif condition:
                statements
            elif condition:
                statements
            elif condition:
                statements
            elif condition:
                statements
            else:
                statements

    -> match-case 

        -> Like elif we have match-case in python for checking "multiple conditions"

        -> Offers a more expressive and readable alternative to 
            complex if-elif-else chains 

        -> Introduced from Python 3.X

        -> In other languages like java / C++ we have (switch case) 

        -> syntax 

            match expression:
                case pattern_1:
                    # code block 1    
                case pattern_2:
                    # code block 2
                case pattern_3:
                    # code block 3
                .
                .

    -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops in Python are used to "repeatedly" execute a block of code

        -> When you want to do a task multiple times, use loops 

        -> Python offers two primary types of loops
            
            -> "while" loops 

            -> "for" loops
        
        -> "while" loops 

            -> while loops execute a block of code repeatedly 
            as long as a specified condition remains True

            -> We use while generally, when we don't know number of
            Iterations/Repetitions in advance

           -> syntax

                while condition:
                    statements 
        

        -> for loop

            -> for loops are used to iterate over a sequence 
                (like a list, tuple, string, or range) 
                or other iterable objects. 
            
            -> NOTE: For loop executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence. 
            
            -> syntax 

                for variable in sequence:
                    statement

            -> We use for generally, when we know number of Iterations in advance 

            -> range() 

                -> The range() function in Python generates an immutable sequence of numbers. 
                It is commonly used for iterating a specific number of times in for loops. 

                -> range(start, stop, step): This form generates a sequence of numbers starting 
                from start (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value, 
                with an increment of step. The step can be positive or negative.

                    range(start, stop, step)
                        -> start default is 0 (included) (inclusive)
                        -> stop at this value (excluded) (exclusive)
                        -> step is increment (default step is 1)

        -> Loops inside Loops

    -> Branching Statements (Jumping Statements)

        -> break : help you exit the loops 

        -> continue : help you skip the current iteration 

        -> pass : acts as a placeholder, does nothing

    -> Control Statements Tasks Solutions 

    -> Strings 

       -> Strings are one of the most widely used Datatype in any programming language 

       -> In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, used to represent text. 
            Strings are a fundamental data type and are widely used for 
            handling and manipulating textual information.

        -> Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> single line strings : use double quotes ("") or single quotes('')

            -> multi line strings : use triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)
    
        -> Rules When Defining Strings 

            -> When you use single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes 
            -> When you use double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes 
            -> When you use both single quote and double quote in a string, 
                enclose them in triple quotes

    -> Accessing Strings 

    -> Indexing 

        -> String indexing in Python allows access to "individual characters within a string" 
            using their "position", known as the "index".
        
        -> Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0, 
            the second at index 1, and so on.

        -> Positive Indexing:
            Starts from the beginning of the string.
            The index of the first character is 0.
        
        -> Negative Indexing:
            Starts from the end of the string.
            The index of the last character is -1.

        -> text = "python"

            0  1  2  3  4  5 [ Positive Indexing ]
            p  y  t  h  o  n 
           -6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  [ Negative Indexing ]

        -> syntax 

            string[index]

            -> NOTE : Accessing invalid index will raise error (IndexError)
    
    -> Slicing

        -> String slicing in Python is a method for extracting a portion (substring) 
        from a larger string. It utilizes the slice operator [] with specific 
        indices to define the desired segment.

        -> syntax 

            string[start:end:step]

                -> start (optional): The index where the slice begins (inclusive). 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).
                -> end (optional): The index where the slice ends (exclusive). 
                    The character at this index is not included. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (the end of the string).
                -> step (optional): The increment between each index during slicing. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 1. 
                    A negative step value can be used to slice in reverse.
            
            -> Earlier we used range()

                range(start,end,step)
    
    
    -> String Concatenation 

        -> Joining the strings 

    -> Formatted String Literals (f-strings)

        -> Using Interpolation {} with f 

    -> String Repetition 

        -> Repeat strings using "*" operator

    -> String Immutability 

        -> Strings are Immutable in nature (Immutable == cannot be changed)

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions/methods that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.

        -> List
        -> Tuple 
        -> Dictionary

    -> List 

        -> List is a data structure which allows you to store multiple values
            in a single variable, each value is separated with , 

        -> Lists are represented using [ ] or using "list" class

        -> Accessing Data In Lists 

            -> Like in Strings, we have index concept in Lists too 

            -> Index Starts with Zero (0)

            -> Supports Positive & Negative Index 

            -> Indexing & Slicing same as strings
