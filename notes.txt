        -> Data Analytics / Data Science / AI   : Data Operations (Numpy, Pandas, Pytorch etc)

        -> Cloud / DevOps                       : Scripting / Automation (OS, Sys, Cloud Boto3 etc)

    -> Core Python which is common for all above courses [ 35 Days ]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals 

    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    
    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High level languages are "Human Understandable" language (English) 

        -> python code looks like english 

            -> sum = num1 + num2

    
    -> Low Level Language 

        -> Low level languages are "Machine Understandable" language (Binary) 

            -> 0101010101010101

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python

    
    -> Python is "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using python, yes we can Develop following types of Applications

            -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> Web Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> Data Oriented Applications ? -> Yes 

            -> API's ? -> Yes 

            -> Automation Scripts ? -> Yes 

    
    -> Domain Specific Languages 

        -> If i can do only specific types of tasks / Applications 

        -> SQL : Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data in "Database" Systems 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the 
        use of significant "indentation"
    
        -> "code readability"

            Java Code 
            ---------
        
            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

            class 
            public
            static
            void
            []
            ()
            {}
            ; 

            
            Python Code 
            -----------

                    number1 = 10
                    number2 = 20
                    sum = number1 + number1
                    print(sum)

                
        -> "indentation"

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we just use "spaces" for indentation 

    
    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Dynamically type-checked 

            -> We have Data Types in programming languages 

                -> Data Types : Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE : Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types 

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 
                    -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked (Java)

            -> NOTE : Static type-checked means, we need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types and it's Mandatory

                    -> String product = "Apple Iphone 16";
                    -> int price = 64000;
                    -> double rating = 4.6; 
                    -> etc  

        -> Garbage-collected

            -> Removing/Cleanup Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically clean up unused data / memory (RAM)

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> python cleans up rating as it's not used 


    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> Compiled Language 

        -> An Compiled Language translates the code into machine code, executes all the code at once 

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are Faster 

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> Python has vast eco system of libraries (*)

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE (2 weeks)

            -> give me 2 years of times 

            -> With Python we don't see speed of Applications 

            -> With Python we focus on Development speed of Applications

==============

    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to 
            conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.

        -> Problem : How To Reach Institute ?

            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk 
            -> Solution 2: I'll come by Bike

        -> We have Two Popular Types 

            -> Imperative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "HOW To DO" 

                -> Object Oriented Programming (OOP)


            -> Declarative Approach 

                -> Focus is on "WHAT TO DO" 

                -> Functional Programming 

        -> Python uses multi paradigm approach i.e we use Imperative Approach & Declarative Approach 


    -> Key Features Of Python / Why Python ?

        -> Simplicity & Easy Readability 

        -> Versatility  

            -> Data Oriented / Full Stack / Cloud Automation / DevOps etc

    -> Python Setup 

        -> open command prompt (windows)

            -> python --version 
            -> if not found download exe and install

        -> open terminal (mac)

            -> python3 --version 

    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (not recommended)

            -> We write the code in command prompt(win) / terminal(mac)

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

        -> Script Mode (recommended)

            -> We write the code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanent, stored on disk 

    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 11:15 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 11:15 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd......z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we form words and then complex sentences over time 


        -> Learn Python  

            -> Python has 35 "keywords" (which are equivalent to english Alphabets)

            -> Using these keywords we form statements using some syntax/rules in python     

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    False      await      else       import     pass
                    None       break      except     in         raise
                    True       class      finally    is         return
                    and        continue   for        lambda     try
                    as         def        from       nonlocal   while
                    assert     del        global     not        with
                    async      elif       if         or         yield

            -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter

            
13th Nov 2025
==============

    -> Python Rules / Syntax

        -> Any python file goes with .py as extension 

        -> Python ignores lines that start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> When working with numerics(1,2,3,4.5,3.14 etc)  
            we can directly use numerics with print() 

        -> When working with text data, in python text data is called as "String"

            -> Strings are supposed to be represented using 
                double quotes "" or single quotes ''
    
    -> Identifiers 

        -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify a piece of data 
            in python code 

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 
        
        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers 

    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named storage location in computers memory (RAM)
            that holds some value or data 

        -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Variables Syntax

            -> variable_name = value

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as assignment operator 
                -> value is data you want to store 

                -> data = 10 (valid)
                -> data = ten (invalid)
                -> data = "ten" (valid) 

        -> Variables Allow You To 

            -> Assign Data (Store Data)

            -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

            -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required)

        -> Combine Variables with your custom statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining String using + operator 

            -> When Combing String with other data types like int, float etc use , operator


14th Nov 2025
==============

    -> We can verify memory location of a Variable 

        -> use id() function 

    -> Memory Model In Python 

        -> If a value is already present, python will not create a memory block
        again for the same value, when working with simple data types 

    -> To Know The Type Of Data / value  

        -> use type() function 

    -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required) Using "Operators"

    
    -> Operators

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", which Performs Operations on Variables 
            and their Values 

        -> There are different types of operator, to deal with different types of data 

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform Mathematical Calculations 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)


        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combine Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python 
        
        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In Conditional Checks 

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check multiple conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F
                            T       F           F         T         F       T
                            F       T           F         T         T       F
                            F       F           F         F         T       T 


        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

            -> NOTE : How do i know if an object is iterable or not ?

                -> dir() - function, tells what kind of operations can be performed 

                    -> if __iter___ is found then you can iterate 
                        i.e you can go with Membership Operators
