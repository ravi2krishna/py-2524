    -> Core Python which is common for all above courses [ 35 Days ]

        -> Python Language Fundamentals 

    -> Python

        -> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the 
        use of significant indentation. 
        Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.

    
    -> Python is a "high-level" programming language

        -> High level languages are "Human Understandable" language (English) 

        -> python code looks like english 

            -> sum = num1 + num2

    
    -> Low Level Language 

        -> Low level languages are "Machine Understandable" language (Binary) 

            -> 0101010101010101

        -> 01110000 01111001 01110100 01101000 01101111 01101110 -> python

    
    -> Python is "general-purpose" programming language

        -> If i can do multiple types of tasks / Applications 

        -> Using python, yes we can Develop following types of Applications

            -> Desktop Applications ? -> Yes

        -> SQL : Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language 
            used to manage data in "Database" Systems 


    -> Python design philosophy emphasizes "code readability" with the 
        use of significant "indentation"
    
        -> "code readability"

            Java Code 
            ---------
        
            class Main {
                public static void main(String[] args) {
                    int first = 10;
                    int second = 20;
                    // add two numbers
                    int sum = first + second;
                    System.out.println(first + " + " + second + " = "  + sum);
                }
            }

            class 
            public
            static
            void
            []
            ()
            {}
            ; 

            
            Python Code 
            -----------

                    number1 = 10
                    number2 = 20
                    sum = number1 + number1
                    print(sum)

                
        -> "indentation"

            -> indentation refers to code Structuring 

            -> In Python we just use "spaces" for indentation 

    
    -> Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected

        -> Dynamically type-checked 

            -> We have Data Types in programming languages 

                -> Data Types : Categorization Of Data 

                    -> text, whole numbers, decimal numbers etc 

            -> NOTE : Dynamically type-checked means, no need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types 

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 
                    -> etc 

        -> Static type-checked (Java)

            -> NOTE : Static type-checked means, we need to explicitly specify 
                        Data Types and it's Mandatory

                    -> String product = "Apple Iphone 16";
                    -> int price = 64000;
                    -> double rating = 4.6; 
                    -> etc  

        -> Garbage-collected

            -> Removing/Cleanup Unused Data 

            -> Python Automatically clean up unused data / memory (RAM)

                    -> product = "Apple Iphone 16"
                    -> price = 64000
                    -> rating = 4.6 

                -> print(product)
                -> print(price)

                -> python cleans up rating as it's not used 


    -> Python is "Interpreted" Language 

        -> An Interpreted Language executes the code "line by line" 

    -> Compiled Language 

        -> An Compiled Language translates the code into machine code, executes all the code at once 

        -> NOTE: Performance wise "Compiled Languages" are Faster 

    -> Considering above criteria, still why Python ?

        -> Easy To Learn / Develop / Code Readability

        -> Python has vast eco system of libraries (*)

        -> Python is best PROTO TYPE LANGUAGE (2 weeks)

            -> give me 2 years of times 

            -> With Python we don't see speed of Applications 

            -> With Python we focus on Development speed of Applications

==============

    -> Programming Paradigms 

        -> A programming paradigm is a relatively high-level way to 
            conceptualize and structure the implementation of a computer program.

        -> Problem : How To Reach Institute ?

            -> Solution 1: I'll come by Walk

            -> python3 --version 

    -> Where To Write Python Code ?

        -> Command Line Mode (not recommended)

            -> We write the code in command prompt(win) / terminal(mac)

            -> Temporary, once we close the session all code is reset 

        -> Script Mode (recommended)

            -> We write the code in files using IDE i.e Visual Studio Code 

            -> Permanent, stored on disk 

    -> How To Write Python Code ?

        -> Any programming language has "syntax" (Rules)

        -> Comparing programming language with english language

            -> i taking class now today at 11:15 AM now (incorrect)

            -> i'm taking class today at 11:15 AM (correct)

        -> Learn English 

            -> English has 26 Alphabets (abcd......z)

            -> Using these Alphabets, we form words and then complex sentences over time 


        -> Learn Python  

            -> Python has 35 "keywords" (which are equivalent to english Alphabets)

            -> Using these keywords we form statements using some syntax/rules in python     

            -> List Of Python keywords

                -> https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords

                    async      elif       if         or         yield

            -> NOTE: All the above keywords hold some special meaning to Python Interpreter

            
13th Nov 2025
==============

    -> Python Rules / Syntax

        -> Any python file goes with .py as extension 

        -> Python ignores lines that start with # 

        -> Comments are represented using # 

        -> When working with numerics(1,2,3,4.5,3.14 etc)  
            we can directly use numerics with print() 

        -> When working with text data, in python text data is called as "String"

            -> Strings are supposed to be represented using 
                double quotes "" or single quotes ''
    
    -> Identifiers 

        -> An identifier is a "name" used to uniquely identify a piece of data 
            in python code 

            -> Variable 
            -> Function 
            -> Class 
            -> Object 
            -> etc 
        
        -> Identifiers Rules 

            -> Can Contain

                -> Letters (a-z A-Z)
                -> Digits (0-9)
                -> Special Symbols ( _ Only underscore)

            -> Must Start With 

                -> A letter or _ (underscore)

        -> NOTE: Always use proper way of naming identifiers 

    -> Variables 

        -> Variable is a named storage location in computers memory (RAM)
            that holds some value or data 

        -> Computer -> RAM -> Variables 

        -> Variables Syntax

            -> variable_name = value

                -> variable_name should follow identifier rules 
                -> = called as assignment operator 
                -> value is data you want to store 

                -> data = 10 (valid)
                -> data = ten (invalid)
                -> data = "ten" (valid) 

        -> Variables Allow You To 

            -> Assign Data (Store Data)

            -> Retrieve Data (Get Data)

            -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required)

        -> Combine Variables with your custom statements 

            -> Concatenation: Joining String using + operator 

            -> When Combing String with other data types like int, float etc use , operator


14th Nov 2025
==============

    -> We can verify memory location of a Variable 

        -> use id() function 

    -> Memory Model In Python 

        -> If a value is already present, python will not create a memory block
        again for the same value, when working with simple data types 

    -> To Know The Type Of Data / value  

        -> use type() function 

    -> Manipulate Data (Change Data If Required) Using "Operators"

    
    -> Operators

        -> Operators are special "Symbols" and "keywords", which Performs Operations on Variables 
            and their Values 

        -> There are different types of operator, to deal with different types of data 

        -> Arithmetic Operators

            -> To Perform Mathematical Calculations 

            -> + - * / % 
            -> // - floor division (same as division but rounds off result)
            -> ** - Exponentiation (used to Calculate powers)


        -> Compound Assignment Operators

            -> Assignment Operator is = (used for assigning a value to Variable)

            -> Compound Assignment Operators Combine Arithmetic Operators 
                with Assignment Operators for "short hand code" (concise code)

                -> x = 10
                -> x = x + 5 (long form)
                -> x = x * 5 (long form)

                -> x += 5 (short form)
                -> x *= 5 (short form)

            -> In Other Programming Languages we got Increment & Decrement Operators

                -> Increment (++)
                -> Decrement (--)

                -> NOTE: Above are not supported in python 
        
        -> Comparison Operators

            -> Comparison Operators are used for Comparing Values
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

                -> Especially Used In Conditional Checks 

                -> ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= 

        -> Logical Operators

            -> For Performing Logical Operations 

            -> Used to check multiple conditions 
                and result is in boolean type (True/False)

            -> and : if both conditions are True, then only result is True, otherwise False 
            -> or : if one of the conditions is True, then result is True, otherwise False 
            -> not : negates the result, if true then false and vice versa 

                            X       Y       X and Y    X or Y    not X    not Y
                            T       T           T         T         F       F
                            T       F           F         T         F       T
                            F       T           F         T         T       F

        -> Membership Operators

            -> Used for checking if an object in in the given sequence 

                -> in : return True, if given object is in sequence

                -> not in : return True, if given object is not in sequence

            -> NOTE : How do i know if an object is iterable or not ?

                -> dir() - function, tells what kind of operations can be performed 

                    -> if __iter___ is found then you can iterate 
                        i.e you can go with Membership Operators


17th Nov 2025
==============

        -> Identity Operators 

            -> Used ofr checking if both objects are same 

                -> is : return True, if objects are same 

                -> is not : return True, if objects are not same 
        
       
        -> Bitwise Operators

            -> Used in Low Level Programming (010101001)

                -> & - if both bits are 1, then result is 1
                -> | - if one the bits is 1, then result is 1

    -> Data Types 

        -> Data Types are Categorization that defines, what kind of data a variable can hold 

        -> Python is dynamic types language(assumes the type based on value)

    -> Numeric Types

        -> int : 1,2,3,0,-1,-2 etc 
        
        -> float : 3.5, 1.5, 2.1 1.0 etc 

        -> complex :

            -> a + ib in math (i - imaginary)

            -> a + bj in python 

    -> Text Type 

        -> str : String is a sequence of characters enclosed in ' ' or " "

    -> Boolean Type

        -> bool : Represents True / False (case sensitive)

    -> None Type

        -> NoneType : Represents nothing i.e absence of value 


    -> Simple Data Types : Hold Single Value in a single variable

    -> Complex Data Types : Hold Multiple Values in a single variable

    -> Sequence Types 

        -> List : List is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using []

        -> Tuple : Tuple is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using ()

        -> NOTE: Technically String is also a sequence type, as it's special 

    -> Set Type 

        -> Set : Set is complex data type i.e it holds multiple values
                  represented using { }

    -> Map Type 

        ->  Dictionary : dict is complex data type i.e it holds multiple key values
                  represented using { } 


    -> NOTE : All above data types are pre-defined in python standard library 

    -> NOTE : Based on custom Requirements coming from users/customers, 
                we can create our own data types 

                -> syntax

                    class CustomDataType:
                        statements

    -> Type Conversion / Implicit Conversion [ Automatic ]

        -> Converting One Data type to another data type, Automatically by Python 

        -> Type Conversion is SAFE i.e no DATA LOSS 

    -> Type Casting / Explicit Conversion [ Manual ]

        -> Converting One Data type to another data type, Manually by Developer 

        -> Type Casting is NOT SAFE i.e DATA LOSS might occur 

        -> syntax

            -> data type(value) # casting functions 


18th Nov 2025
==============

    -> Control Structures / Control statements

        -> Control Structures helps you determine the flow of execution 
            in a python program, allowing you to "make decisions" and "repeat tasks".

        -> Python has given three types of Control Structures

            -> Conditional Structures / Statements (Decision Making Statements)

            -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

            -> Branching Structures / Statements (Jump Statements)

        -> NOTE: To Work with above Control Structures, indentation knowledge is must

    -> Indentation

        -> Indentation in Python is a fundamental and mandatory aspect of its "syntax", 
            used to define the structure and hierarchy of code blocks. 
            Unlike many other programming languages that use curly braces or keywords 
            to delineate blocks, Python relies entirely on "consistent" indentation.

        -> Using space as indentation (using spaces correctly is important)

        -> Python allows for any consistent number of spaces or 
            a single tab(4 spaces) for indentation,

        -> Used to run a "block of code" based on a condition result 

            -> if 

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 

                    -> syntax 
                        if condition:
                            statements

                -> runs a block of code, if the condition is True 
                    runs another block of code, if the condition is False

            -> NOTE: Interpolation & input(), we use them for dynamic inputs & outputs 

            -> Interpolation 

                -> Interpolation technique replaces, place holders with actual values dynamically

                -> Using "f-strings" (Formatted String Literals)

                    -> we use f with print and {} as place holders 

            -> input(): function reads input from user 

        -> The ternary operator in Python, also known as a "conditional expression", 
            provides a concise way(short hand code) to write an 
            if-else statement on a single line.
             
            It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values 
            based on whether the condition is true or false.

    -> syntax 
        value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

==============

    -> elif ladder 

        -> elif is a keyword that stands for "else if" 

        -> It is used in conditional statements to check "multiple conditions"
            sequentially after an initial if statement
        
        -> Syntax

            if condition:
                statements
            elif condition:
                statements

        -> Offers a more expressive and readable alternative to 
            complex if-elif-else chains 

        -> Introduced from Python 3.X

    -> Looping Structures / Statements (Iteration Statements)

        -> Loops in Python are used to "repeatedly" execute a block of code

        -> When you want to do a task multiple times, use loops 

        -> Python offers two primary types of loops
            
            -> "while" loops 

            -> "for" loops
        
        -> "while" loops 

            -> while loops execute a block of code repeatedly 
            as long as a specified condition remains True

            -> We use while generally, when we don't know number of
            Iterations/Repetitions in advance

           -> syntax

                while condition:
                    statements 
        

        -> for loop

            -> for loops are used to iterate over a sequence 
                (like a list, tuple, string, or range) 
                or other iterable objects. 
            
            -> NOTE: For loop executes a block of code once for each item in the sequence. 
            
            -> syntax 

                for variable in sequence:
                    statement

            -> We use for generally, when we know number of Iterations in advance 

            -> range() 

                -> The range() function in Python generates an immutable sequence of numbers. 
                It is commonly used for iterating a specific number of times in for loops. 

                -> range(start, stop, step): This form generates a sequence of numbers starting 
                from start (inclusive) up to, but not including, the stop value, 
                with an increment of step. The step can be positive or negative.

                    range(start, stop, step)
                        -> start default is 0 (included) (inclusive)
                        -> stop at this value (excluded) (exclusive)
                        -> step is increment (default step is 1)

    -> Control Statements Tasks Solutions 

    -> Strings 

       -> Strings are one of the most widely used Datatype in any programming language 

       -> In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, used to represent text. 
            Strings are a fundamental data type and are widely used for 
            handling and manipulating textual information.

        -> Strings are enclosed in double quotes ("") or single quotes('') or 
            triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)

            -> single line strings : use double quotes ("") or single quotes('')

            -> multi line strings : use triple quotes(''' ''') or (""" """)
    
        -> Rules When Defining Strings 

            -> When you use single quote in a string, enclose them in double quotes 
            -> When you use double quote in a string, enclose them in single quotes 
            -> When you use both single quote and double quote in a string, 
                enclose them in triple quotes

    -> Accessing Strings 

    -> Indexing 

        -> String indexing in Python allows access to "individual characters within a string" 
            using their "position", known as the "index".
        
        -> Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0, 
            the second at index 1, and so on.

        -> Positive Indexing:
            Starts from the beginning of the string.
            The index of the first character is 0.
        
        -> Negative Indexing:
            Starts from the end of the string.
            The index of the last character is -1.

        -> text = "python"

            0  1  2  3  4  5 [ Positive Indexing ]
            p  y  t  h  o  n 
           -6  -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  [ Negative Indexing ]

        -> syntax 

            string[index]

            -> NOTE : Accessing invalid index will raise error (IndexError)
    
    -> Slicing

        -> String slicing in Python is a method for extracting a portion (substring) 
        from a larger string. It utilizes the slice operator [] with specific 
        indices to define the desired segment.

        -> syntax 

            string[start:end:step]

                -> start (optional): The index where the slice begins (inclusive). 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the string).
                -> end (optional): The index where the slice ends (exclusive). 
                    The character at this index is not included. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to the length of the string (the end of the string).
                -> step (optional): The increment between each index during slicing. 
                    If omitted, it defaults to 1. 
                    A negative step value can be used to slice in reverse.
            
            -> Earlier we used range()

    -> String Methods 

        -> String methods in Python are built-in functions/methods that operate on 
        string objects, allowing for various manipulations, transformations, and checks. 
        It is important to note that strings in Python are immutable, 
        meaning these methods do not modify the original string but 
        instead return a new string with the applied changes.

    -> Functional Style Programming 

        -> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm 
            where programs are constructed by applying and composing "functions"

    
    -> Functions 

        -> In Python, a function is a named, "reusable block of code" that performs 
            a specific task, takes input (arguments), processes data, 
            and can return an output.

    -> Why Functions 

        ->  For writing modular, organized and efficient code.

        -> Functions can break down complex problems into smaller and
            simpler manageable sub tasks for promoting code modularity. 

        -> Once defined a function, it can be called multiple times, so that 
            we can achieve code reusability.

        -> Functions are defined using "def" keyword, followed by function name,
        parenthesis(which may contain parameters), and a colon:
        the code within the function is indented 

        -> syntax

            def function_name():
                statements

            def function_name(parameters):
                statements

        -> NOTE: calling function is must

            function_name()

    -> Python functions can be defined to accept "parameters" 
        which can act as placeholders for values that will be 
        passed into function when called. 
    
    -> Values passed to the function we call them as "arguments"

    -> We use parameters to make functions dynamic in nature 

    -> Based On arguments passed to functions, we got five types 

        -> Positional Arguments 

        -> Keywords Arguments 

        -> Default Arguments 

        -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments

    -> Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, positional arguments are values passed to a function during 
        its call, where the assignment of these values to the function's parameters 
        is determined solely by their order (position) in the argument list. 
        
        -> The first argument in the function call is assigned to the first parameter 
        in the function definition, the second to the second, and so on. 

        -> Order Matters: If the order is incorrect, the function will receive the wrong values 
            for its intended parameters, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior.

    
    -> Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, keyword arguments are a way to pass values to a function by explicitly 
        "naming the parameters" they correspond to, rather than relying on their position 
            in the argument list. 
        
        -> This offers several advantages, primarily in terms of code readability and flexibility.
    
    -> Default Arguments 

        -> In Python, default arguments allow you to define a function parameter 
            with a "pre-assigned" value. 
        
        -> If a caller does not provide an argument for that parameter during a function call, 
            the default value is automatically used. 
            If an argument is provided, it overrides the default.

        -> Placement Requirement: Default arguments must always be placed after 
            any non-default (positional) arguments in the function definition. 
            Attempting to place a non-default argument after a 
                default argument will result in a SyntaxError.

    -> Arbitrary Positional Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary positional arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of non-keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (*) before a parameter name 
                in the function definition. 
            
        -> This parameter will then collect all the extra positional arguments passed 
            to the function into a single tuple. 

    
    -> Arbitrary Keywords Arguments

        -> In Python, arbitrary keyword arguments allow a function to accept 
            a variable/unknown number of keyword arguments. 
            This is achieved by placing an asterisk (**) before a parameter name 
                in the function definition. 

        -> This parameter will be collected into a dictionary, where the names will be keys and 
            values will be dictionary values  

12th Dec 2025
==============

    -> return keyword 

        -> In Python, the "return" keyword is used within a function to send a value 
        back to the part of the code that called the function.

        -> when you don't use a return, by default a function returns None 

        -> When working with function composition (function calling another function), 
            return will be helpful 

        -> If you use return, make sure it's the last part of statement to be executed

        -> If you have multiple return statements, first will be considered

        -> If multiple returns are present, and used with conditionals, 
            you can control the flow 

    -> Scopes in functions 

        -> Scope: Inside the code blocks, where you can access variable depends on Scope

            -> Local 

            -> Global 

        -> Local Scope

            -> A local variable declared "inside the function" 
            -> it's lifetime exists only within the function
            -> we cannot use them outside the function    
            -> NOTE : Parameters we are passing to the functions, are also local variables  
        
        -> Global Scope

            -> A Global variable declared outside the function 
            -> it's lifetime exists within the function as well as outside function 

            -> As global variables can be accessed inside the functions, there can be
            name conflicts, in this scenario the preference is given to local variables 

                -> NOTE : To Access Global Variable in above scenario, use globals()

            -> If you want global variables to be changed inside the function, we cannot 
                do that directly 

                -> NOTE : To change Global Variable inside function, use global keyword

    -> Types Of Functions 

        -> Built In Functions 

        -> User Defined Functions 

        -> Lambda Functions 

        -> Higher Order Functions 

    
    -> Built In Functions 

        -> Pre Defined Functions, already part of Standard Python Library 

        -> No need to create explicitly again using def keyword 

        -> Just call them using function name 

        -> Examples 

            -> id(), type(), dir(), input(), len(), max(), min() etc 

    
    -> User Defined Functions 

        -> User Defined functions, are created by Developers using def keyword 

        -> Created based on Customers Requirement 

        -> Examples 

            -> add(), emp_info(), math_ops() etc 


15th Dec 2025
==============

    -> The ability of functional programming languages to treat functions as values and 
        pass them to functions as parameters.

    -> Lambda Functions (Anonymous Functions) 

        -> A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function 
            defined with the "lambda" keyword. 

        -> Unlike standard functions defined with def, lambda functions are 
            restricted to a "single expression", which is "implicitly returned"
        
        -> They are often used for "short, one-time operations" where 
                a full function definition would be unnecessarily verbose.
        
        -> syntax

                lambda arguments:expression

        -> Using lambda we can write one liner functions called "IILE" 
                Immediately Invoked Lambda Expression  

    -> Lambda & Higher Order Functions 

    -> Generally lambda functions will be "attached" with "Higher Order Functions" 

    -> Higher Order Functions 

        -> The goal of Higher Order Functions is to "perform operations on Iterables" 

        -> Concise Code, without writing lengthy code with loops and conditionals

            -> NOTE: Remember Imperative vs Declarative Style (How To Do vs What To Do) 

        -> map()

                -> The map() function in Python is a built-in function that applies 
                    a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, or string) 
                    and returns an iterator containing the results. 
                    
                -> It provides a concise way to perform "transformations" on 
                    collections of data without explicitly writing loops. 

                    -> syntax

                        map(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with function

        -> filter()

                -> The filter() function in Python is a built-in function used to construct an iterator 
                from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. 
                It is a powerful tool for selectively extracting data based on a given condition.

                -> syntax

                        filter(function, iterable)

                -> NOTE: Just Like Using For Loop with Conditions 

        -> reduce()

                -> The reduce() function in Python, found within the "functools" module, 
                is a higher-order function that applies a given function cumulatively 
                to the items of an iterable, 
                reducing the iterable to a single, cumulative value.

                -> from functools import reduce

                -> syntax

                        reduce(function, iterable)

    -> Functional Style With CRUD Application

    -> Additionally Implement "Search Students By Skill" Using Higher Order 
            functions approach 

    -> Modules 

        -> A module is simple python file which contains python definitions 

            -> variables 
            -> functions 
            -> classes 
            -> etc 
        
        -> Modules Allow you to reuse code, instead of rewriting 

        -> NOTE: Reusability in terms of code blocks go for functions 

        -> NOTE: Reusability in terms of files go for modules 

    -> Types Of Modules

        -> Inbuilt Modules 

            -> Provided as part of standard python library 

        -> User Defined Modules

            -> Created By User/Developer 

            -> import using file name 

        -> External Modules 

            -> Provided by 3rd party vendors 

                -> https://pypi.org

            -> pip (python package manager)

                -> pip install module_name 
                -> pip install pandas 

                -> https://pypi.org/project/requests/

    -> syntax

        -> import module (imports complete module i.e loading all Functionalities) 

        -> from module import specific_functionality (import only what you need)  (recommended)


17th Dec 2025
==============

    -> Reusability

        -> A Block Of Code - functions (call with function_name)

        -> A File Of Code - modules (call with file_name)

        -> A Folder Of Code - packages (call with folder_name)

    -> Package 

        -> A folder with multiple "modules" (multiple python files)   

        -> A package contains a special file named as __init__.py 

        -> __init__.py, it can be blank, but generally we keep start up 
                initial data or start up configurations 
            
        -> In order to use package, use name of the folder

    
    -> File Management With Python 

        -> After executing 12_functions/app.py 
            we can confirm data is being stored "Temporarily" 

        -> All the activities we performed so far, were dealing with
            "Non-Persistent" Storage (RAM / MEMORY)

            -> Non-Persistent Storage is "Temporary" 
        
        -> Now the Requirement is to work with "Persistent" Storage (HARD DISK) 

                -> Persistent Storage is "Permanent" 

    -> File Operations 

        -> CRUD 

            -> Create File
            -> Read File
            -> Update File
            -> Delete File

    -> To Work With Any Type Of File, python has provided

        -> open() function

        -> open() function 

            -> Modes 

                -> r - read 
                -> w - write (overwrite data)
                -> a - append (preserve old data and then add new data)
                -> etc 

        -> syntax - 1

            open("file_path","mode"):
                statements 
            
            open("file.txt","r"):
                statements 
            
            -> NOTE: Here we need to explicitly close files after 
                operations are performed 

        -> syntax - 2 (recommended way)

            with open("file_path","mode") as alias_name:
                statements 
            
            open("file.txt","r") as file_data:
                statements 
            
            -> NOTE: Here implicitly files are closed, 
                after operations are performed 

    -> File Reading "r" mode 

        -> read()
        -> readline()
        -> readlines()

    -> File Writing "w" mode 

        -> write()
        -> writelines()

        -> NOTE: In "w" mode, previous data is overridden 

    -> File Writing "a" mode [ Append Mode ]

        -> NOTE: In "w" mode, previous data is not overridden 

18th Dec 2025
==============

    -> Folder / Directory Management 

        -> "os" module 
        -> "shutil" module 

    -> Create Folders & Delete Folders can be done with above modules 

    -> Working with "csv" module 

        -> Very commonly used in "Data Oriented Applications"

        -> For Fixed Data Sets, we can use "reader" functionality from csv module

            -> students.csv file

        -> For Changing Data Sets, we can use DictReader functionality from csv module


19th Dec 2025
==============

    -> We have read & write Functionalities with CSV Files 

        -> reader
        -> DictReader 

        -> writer 
        -> DictWriter  

            -> writerow
            -> writerows 

    -> Working With JSON Data / Files 

    -> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-readable, text-based format 
    for "storing" and "exchanging" data that is widely used for 
    web applications, APIs, and configuration files. 

    -> JSON represents data as key-value pairs within objects 
        (enclosed in curly braces {}) -> same as Dictionary in python

    -> https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/0e4bef351d9e23cdb33adba9e491f73db3c9c50c/7dcfe/data.png

    -> https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/weather-forecast

    -> Very Commonly Used in Application Development (API's)

    -> We have "json" module built in python standard library 

    -> json operations

        -> dump -> as a file we can store/write data, it accepts data and filename

        -> load -> from a json file we can read data 

        -> dumps -> object based writing 

        -> loads -> object based reading


22nd Dec 2025
==============

    -> Student Management System - With File Storage On Disk (persistent data)

23rd Dec 2025
==============

    -> Exception Handling 

        -> Exception : It's an "Error", which might occur during the program execution 

        -> By default when python encounters an Error, it abruptly "STOPS" the program execution

    -> To change the above default behavior, and handle the Exceptions 
            by yourself, we need following

            -> try: used to keep the code, that will cause error 

            -> except: used to keep the code that should run, when errors occur 

                -> Try statement must have at least one except or finally clause

            -> else: used to keep the code that short run, if No Exception was raised in try block

            -> finally: used to keep the code that should run, whether an exception raised or not 
                        DB / Files -> closing connections will be in done in finally block 

    -> Earlier we worked with In built Exceptions provided as part of 
        python standard library (ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, ValueError etc)

        -> https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html 

    -> But sometimes you need your "own custom errors" that describes a situation 
        Specific to your program 
    
    -> You create a custom exception by "defining a class" that inherits 
        from Python’s built-in "Exception" class. 
        This concept is connected to inheritance.

        -> All user-defined exceptions should also be derived from Exception class.

        -> syntax

            class MyCustomError(Exception):
                pass
